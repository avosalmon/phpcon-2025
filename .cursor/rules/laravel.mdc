- This project uses Laravel v12 with Inertia.js v2. Make sure to follow the latest syntax of these framework/library versions and best practices.

## Testing

- For testing, this project uses Pest v3. Always write tests using Pest functionalities. Don't write tests with plain PHPUnit.
- Use the `it` function, not the `test` function.
- Do not use `$this` to call the TestCase methods. Use Pest's global functions. e.g. Use `post()` instead of `$this->post()`
- Chain the response assertions instead of assigning the reponse to a variable.
